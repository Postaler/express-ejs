          <p>Hey, I’m Andrei — I’m currently learning web development and diving into Node.js, React, and front-end tech. I’m part of the MAXX Potential internship and a QA bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience with building projects and testing software.</p>

          <p>I’m into figuring out how things work, fixing bugs, and building apps that are actually useful. I like learning by doing — and breaking stuff along the way if that’s what it takes.</p>
